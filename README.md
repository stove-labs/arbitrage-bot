# Stove Labs Arbitrage Bot

This arbitrage bot speculates on the price differences between two markets, by taking advantage of the difference in asset prices and trades for a profit. The strategy is to buy crypto at a lower price on one exchange and sell immediately at a higher price on the other.

## Benefits

- Modular plugin architecture: easy to expand support for more markets; improve reporting capabilities or replacing tailored profit finding algorithms (eg. stable swap).

- Automated price discovery and arbitrage execution and reporting to the console.

- User defined objective for which *base token asset* should be accumulated over time.

- Trade reverts if market conditions change to the worse and therefore profit opportunity vanishes.

- Multiplier for transaction fee can be increased to stay competitive. 

## Learning resource

The exercise of using and building upon the arbitrage-bot offers a fantastic hands-on opportunity to learn about blockchain and Tezos development. While the use-case presents technical challenges, it can be overwhelming to extract those learnings by merely going through the code. Therefore, this section lists some of the design/development challenges and discusses their solutions & practical implementations.

1. Read AMM spot price (exchange plugins: eg. [Quipuswap](packages/plugins//exchanges//tezos-dex-quipuswap/README.md#learning-resource))
2. Compose batch transactions, estimate & apply adjusted FEEs ([swap-execution](packages/plugins/arbitrage-bot-swap-execution/README.md#learning-resource))
3. Contract views to read FA2 and FA1.2 token balances ([accountant](packages/plugins/arbitrage-bot-accountant/README.md#learning-resource))
4. Price discovery for arbitrage between 2 DEXs ([profit-finder](packages/plugins/arbitrage-bot-profit-finder-lite/README.md#learning-resource))
5. Solve polling (without subscribing to block updates) ([trigger](packages/plugins/arbitrage-bot-trigger-chain/README.md#learning-resource))

## Limitations
The current implementation:
- Does not have a centralized exchange (CEX) plugin
- FA1.2 tokens
- Supports two (CFMMs) decentralized exchanges on Tezos blockchain:
    - Quipuswap (v1) XTZ<>Token
    - Vortex XTZ<>Token
- Reporting to console

## Future work
- FA2
- Quipuswap (v2)
- Token<>Token

## Project Organization

`@stove-labs/arbitrage-bot` is organized as a mono repository from which several npm packages are built and published. High level packages are organized in the `packages/` directory, whereas plugins can be found in `packages/plugins/`. Exchange specific plugins are in `packages/plugins/exchanges/`. Please note that each package has its own README file.

We publish packages to npmjs.org under the `@stove-labs` namespace and packages have usually `@stove-labs/arbitrage-bot-*` format. See below for a complete overview.

### Useful npm command targets/scripts

See the top-level `package.json` "scripts" section. Some common targets are:

* `npm run bootstrap`: Install all dependencies and link packages locally
* `npm run clean`: Recursively delete all build artifacts
* `npm run build`: Compile all packages
* `npm run test:all`: Run all unit tests
* `npm run test:all:watch`: Run all unit tests in watch mode


### [WIP] Running Integration Tests

The arbitrage-bot integration tests are located in the `/integration-tests/` directory. The build steps are still work in progress to ensure a smooth developer experience across various CPU architectures (including M1) and Tezos blockchain protocols.
